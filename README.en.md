# Windsurf Auto Rules Generation and Agile Workflow Templates

English | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](README.md)

> This project is adapted from [cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow](https://github.com/bmadcode/cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow) for Windsurf. Special thanks to [@bmadcode](https://github.com/bmadcode) for their excellent work.

**Important Update**

Windsurf, as a revolutionary AI programming IDE, provides unique rule generation and management mechanisms. This template aims to help developers quickly establish and maintain AI code generation rules through natural language.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** For a complete guide to the Windsurf agile workflow system, please refer to the [Agile Workflow Documentation](docs/agile-readme.en.md).

## Core Features

Through fine-grained rules and customized workflows, you can fully leverage the potential of Windsurf AI agents. This template ensures:

- Rules are automatically and accurately applied
- Support for precise rule usage on demand
- Continuous optimization of AI agent learning and improvement capabilities

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Interactive Initialization (Recommended)

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/hipcn/windsurf-agile-workflow-toolkit.git
cd windsurf-agile-workflow-toolkit
.\init-project.ps1

# Linux/Mac
git clone https://github.com/hipcn/windsurf-agile-workflow-toolkit.git
cd windsurf-agile-workflow-toolkit
chmod +x init-project.sh
./init-project.sh
```

The interactive initialization script will:
- Guide you through project information input
- Automatically create necessary directory structures
- Copy and configure all templates
- Initialize Git repository
- Provide next steps guidance

### Method 2: Manual Configuration

```bash
# Windows
.\apply-rules.bat D:\path\to\your\project

# Linux/Mac
./apply-rules.sh /path/to/your/project

Examples:
# Windows
.\apply-rules.bat D:\Projects\openmanus

# Linux/Mac
./apply-rules.sh /home/user/projects/openmanus
```
